      <h1>DOM Level 3 support</h1>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon 8.2 introduced support for JAXP 1.3 and DOM Level 3. Unfortunately this caused
         complications in the installation procedure, because these specifications are not supported
         "out of the box" with Java JDK 1.4. Saxon 8.3 includes various changes designed to remove
         these problems. This section describes the changes to DOM support; the next section describes
         changes to the XPath API.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><b>Saxon 8.3 introduces significant changes in the way that DOM interfaces are supported.</b></p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The two implementations of the Saxon object model, Tree and TinyTree, no longer implement
         DOM interfaces. This change is made for two reasons: firstly, there are incompatibilities between 
         the DOM interface in JDK 1.4 and JDK 1.5 that make it impossible to support both
         with the same code, and secondly, the ever-increasing complexity of the DOM interface burdens
         the Saxon implementation without adding anything useful for most users.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">So the <code>NodeInfo</code> implementations in these two tree models no longer implement <code>org.w3.dom.Node</code>
         and its subclasses. Instead, it is possible to wrap a Saxon <code>NodeInfo</code> object in a new class,
         <code>NodeOverNodeInfo</code>, which adds the DOM methods. 
         When a Saxon node is supplied to an extension function
         that expects a DOM Node or NodeList, Saxon performs this wrapping automatically. This actually means that
         it is now possible to supply any kind of Saxon node to an extension function that expects a DOM Node - previously
         not all Saxon nodes implemented the DOM Node interface (for example some parentless nodes, or text nodes in
         some temporary trees, or nodes that wrap JDOM or XOM nodes).
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Because the Saxon tree implementations no longer implement the DOM, the JAXP factory class
         <code>net.sf.saxon.om.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl</code> is no longer available. In addition, it is no longer
         possible to use the JAXP <code>DOMSource</code> class to supply a Saxon tree as a source or result for
         a transformation. Instead, you can supply a <code>NodeInfo</code> directly as a <code>Source</code>, or a
         <code>TreeBuilder</code> or <code>TinyBuilder</code> as a <code>Result</code>. 
         There are examples in <code>TraxExamples.java</code> that show how to do this.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon still supports <code>DOMSource</code> and <code>DOMResult</code> as the source or result
         of a transformation. However, they must now encapsulate a third-party DOM Node. 
         They are not used when transforming to or from Saxon trees.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">All modules in Saxon that are concerned with DOM support have been moved out of the
         main JAR file into <code>saxon-dom.jar</code>, which need not be on the classpath if DOM interfaces are
         not required. There are now no references to DOM interfaces in the main body of Saxon code. DOM therefore
         has exactly the same status as other external object models, for example JDOM and XOM. In fact, it is now
         possible to register a support module for an additional external object model with the Saxon <code>Configuration</code>,
         so object models are now completely pluggable.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">If DOM interfaces are needed, then the classpath should contain both <code>saxon-dom.jar</code>
         and the DOM level 3 classes. The DOM level 3 classes are a standard part of JDK 1.5, but under JDK 1.4
         they must be installed separately, as part of the JAXP 1.3 package. The requisite JAR file is simply called
         <code>dom.jar</code>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The <code>SchemaType</code> interface in Saxon no longer implements the DOM <code>TypeInfo</code>
         interface. Instead, a <code>TypeInfo</code> can be now be obtained by wrapping a <code>SchemaType</code>
         in a <code>TypeInfoImpl</code>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Similarly, Saxon no longer provides native support for the DOM <code>LSResourceResolver</code> interface.
         In places where it is needed, for example in the validation API, an <code>LSResourceResolver</code> can be
         packaged inside a <code>URIResourceResolver</code>, which makes it look like a standard JAXP
         <code>URIResolver</code>. The Saxon <code>Configuration</code> and <code>PipelineConfiguration</code>
         now allow only a <code>URIResolver</code> to be registered directly, but the validation APIs get round this
         by registering a <code>URIResourceResolver</code> that wraps the <code>LSResourceResolver</code>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">A method <code>getPrefix()</code> has been added to <code>NodeInfo</code>. This method was 
         previously available on nodes that implemented the DOM <code>Node</code> interface, but not on
         other nodes.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The net effect of these changes is:</p>
      
      
      <ul xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
         
         <li>
            <p>To run XQuery or XSLT, the only JAR file you need on the classpath is saxon8.jar, and this will run
               under either JDK 1.4 or JDK 1.5.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>If you use the XPath API defined in JAXP 1.3, you will also need saxon8-xpath.jar on the classpath. If you
               use this with JDK 1.4, you will also need to download the JAXP 1.3 component from Sun, and place the jaxp-api.jar
               JAR file on your classpath.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>If you use DOM level 3 interfaces under JAXP 1.3, you will also need the dom.jar file from the JAXP 1.3 distribution
               on your classpath.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>If you recompile Saxon, it is easiest to do so under JDK 1.5; but you can recompile under JDK 1.4 if all the
               necessary JAXP components are present.
            </p>
         </li>
         
      </ul>
