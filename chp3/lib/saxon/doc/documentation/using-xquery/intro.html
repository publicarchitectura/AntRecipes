      <h1>Using XQuery</h1>
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">This section describes how to use Saxon as an XQuery processor, either from the command line,
         or from the Java API.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><i>For details of how to set up collation URIs for use in XQuery,
            see <a class="bodylink" href="javascript:topage('conformance', 'collation-uri')">Collation URIs</a></i></p>
      
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon supports XQuery 1.0 as well as XSLT 2.0.</p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The run-time code for both languages is identical, reflecting the fact that
         they have very similar semantics. Most of the compile-time code (in particular, the
         type checking logic and the optimizer) is also common. The XQuery support in Saxon consists essentially
         of an XQuery parser (which is itself an extension of the XPath parser); the parser
         generates the same internal interpretable code as the XSLT processor.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The XQuery processor may be invoked either from the operating system command line,
         or via an API from a Java application. There is no graphical user interface provided.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon is an in-memory processor. Whether you use XSLT or XQuery, Saxon is designed
         to process source documents that fit in memory. Saxon has been used successfully to process
         source documents of 100Mbytes or more, but if you attempt anything this large, you need to be
         aware (a) that you will need to allocate sufficient memory to the Java VM (at least 5 times the size
         of the source document), and (b) that complex FLWR expressions may be very time-consuming to
         execute. In fact, large documents are currently easier to process efficiently using XSLT, which 
         offers the <code>xsl:key</code> facility for efficient direct access.
