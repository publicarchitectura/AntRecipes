      <h1>Schema-Aware XSLT from the Command Line</h1>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">To run a schema-aware transformation from the command line, use the <code>com.saxonica.Transform</code> command
         instead of the usual <code>net.sf.saxon.Transform</code>. This has an additional option <code>-val</code> to
         request strict validation of the source document. This applies not only to the principal source document loaded from the
         command line, but to all documents loaded via the <code>doc()</code> and <code>document()</code> functions.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">As an alternative to the <code>-val</code> option, you can specify <code>-vlax</code> to request lax
         validation.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The schemas to be used to validate these source documents can be specified either by using the
         <code>xsl:import-schema</code> declaration in the stylesheet, or using <code>xsi:schemaLocation</code>
         (or <code>xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation</code>) attributes within the source documents themselves.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Validating the source document has several effects. Most obviously, it will cause the transformation to fail
         if the document is invalid. It will also cause default values for attributes and elements to be expanded, so they
         will appear to the stylesheet as if they were present on the source document. In addition, element and attribute nodes
         that have been validated will be annotated with a type. This enables operations to be performed in a type-safe way.
         This may cause error messages, for example if you try to use an xs:decimal value as an argument to a function that
         expects a string. It may also cause some operations to produce different results: for example when using
         elements or attribute that have been given a list type in the schema, the typed value of the node will appear
         in the stylesheet as a sequence rather than as a single string value.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon-SA also allows you to validate result documents (both final result documents
         and temporary trees), using the <code>validation</code> and <code>type</code> attributes. For details of these,
         refer to the XSLT 2.0 specification. Validation of result documents is done on-the-fly, so if the stylesheet
         attempts to produce invalid output, you will usually get an error message that identifies the offending instruction
         in the stylesheet. Type annotations on final result documents are lost if you send the output to a standard JAXP
         <code>Result</code> object (whether it's a <code>StreamResult</code>, <code>SAXResult</code>, or <code>DOMResult</code>,
         but they remain available if you capture the output in a Saxon <code>Receiver</code> or in a <code>DOMResult</code>
         that encapsulates a Saxon <code>NodeInfo</code>. For details of the way in which type annotations are represented
         in the Saxon implementation of the data model, see the JavaDoc documentation. The <code>getTypeAnnotation()</code>
         method on a <code>NodeInfo</code> object returns an integer fingerprint, which can be used to locate the name of the
         relevant type in the <code>NamePool</code>. The <code>NamePool</code> also provides the ability to locate the actual
         type definitions in the schema model, starting from these integer fingerprints.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><i>The <code>type</code> attribute is not currently supported on instructions that create document nodes,
            as distinct from element or attribute nodes.</i></p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The <code>-vw</code> option on the command line 
         causes validation errors encountered in processing a final result
         tree to be treated as warnings, allowing processing to continue. This allows more than one error
         to be reported in a single run. The result document is serialized as if validation were successful,
         but with XML comments inserted to show where the validation errors were found. This option does
         not necessarily recover from all validation errors, for example at present it does not recover from
         errors in uniqueness or referential constraints. It applies only to result trees
         validated using the <code>validation</code> attribute of <code>xsl:result-document</code>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">With the schema-aware version of Saxon, type declarations (the <code>as</code> attribute on elements such as
         <code>xsl:function</code>, <code>xsl:variable</code>, and <code>xsl:param</code>) can refer to schema-defined types,
         for example you can write <code>&lt;xsl:variable name="a" as="schema-element(ipo:invoice)"/&gt;</code>. You can also use
         the <code>element()</code> and <code>attribute()</code> tests to select nodes by their schema type in path expressions
         and match patterns. See <a class="bodylink" href="javascript:topage('conformance', 'intro')">conformance.html</a> to check which parts of the syntax have
         been implemented.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon 8.2 does a certain amount of static analysis of the XSLT and XPath code based on schema information.
         For example, if a template rule is defined with a match pattern such as <code>match="schema-element(invoice)"</code>,
         then it will check any path expressions used in the template rule to ensure that they are valid against the schema
         when starting from <code>invoice</code> as the context node. Similarly, if the result type of a template rule
         or function is declared using an <code>as</code> attribute, then Saxon will check any literal result elements
         in the body of the template or function to ensure that they are consistent with this declared type. This
         analysis can reveal many simple user errors at compile time that would otherwise result in run-time errors or
         simply in incorrect output. But this is only possible if the source code explicitly declares the types of parameters,
         template and function results, and match patterns.
