      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">An index of all currently-available open-source versions of Saxon is on 
         <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=29872" target="_blank" class="bodylink">the download page at SourceForge</a></p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">For the Saxon-SA product, please follow the download links from
         <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">http://www.saxonica.com/</a></p>

      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Installation of Saxon simply involves unzipping the supplied download file into a
         suitable directory. The procedure is the same for the Standard product and the Schema-Aware
         product. The two products can co-exist in the same directory or in different directories.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">One of the files that will be created in this directory is the principal JAR file. This is
         <b>saxon8.jar</b> in the case of Saxon-B, <b>saxon8sa.jar</b> in the case of Saxon-SA.
         There are additional JAR files to support optional features including the JDOM interface and the SQL
         interface. When running Saxon, the principal JAR file should be on the class path. The class path
         is normally represented by an environment variable named CLASSPATH: see your Java documentation
         for details. Note that the JAR file itself (not the directory that contains it) should be named on the class path.

                     They
                     are needed, however, if you run Saxon 8.2 under JDK 1.4. These two JAR files are not included in the

                     interfaces. Neither is needed for running straightforward queries or transformations.

         -x or -y options; from the Java API, set the name of the parser class as an attribute of
