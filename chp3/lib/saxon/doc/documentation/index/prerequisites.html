      <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The following software must be installed separately, it is not included with the Saxon download.</p>
      
      
      <ul xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
         
         <li>
            <p>To run Saxon you need at least a Java VM, and preferably a Java development environment. 
               Saxon 8.3 will run with either JDK 1.4 (properly the Java 2 platform, Standard Edition, v 1.4)
               or JDK 1.5 (properly Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 5.0).
            </p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>Saxon will no longer work with the Microsoft Java VM.</p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>Saxon implements APIs defined in JAXP 1.3 (JAXP is the Java API for XML Processing). JAXP 1.3
               is a standard component in JDK 1.5, but if you are using JDK 1.4, it must be installed separately.
               For licensing reasons the JAXP package is not included in the Saxon distribution; instead you must
               download it separately from <a href="https://jaxp.dev.java.net/">https://jaxp.dev.java.net/</a>.
               This download includes two JAR files, <code>jaxp-api.jar</code> and <code>dom.jar</code>, which
               must be present on the classpath when running Saxon. Note that this means you cannot invoke Saxon
               using the <code>-jar</code> option, since this requires all files to be present in a single JAR archive,
               and ignores the CLASSPATH setting.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Most XSLT and XQuery functionality in Saxon will work without installing JAXP 1.3. You need
               to install it if you are using DOM interfaces; if you are using the XPath API; or if you are using
               the schema validation API (applies to Saxon-SA only).
            </p>
            
            
            <p><i>It is likely that at some time in the future, Saxon will require J2SE 5.0</i></p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>Saxon has an option to work with a source tree constructed using
               <a href="http://www.jdom.org/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">JDOM</a>. Saxon 8.3 is validated with
               JDOM 1.0; it probably also works with other recent releases. To use Saxon with JDOM,
               you need to add <code>saxon8-jdom.jar</code> to your CLASSPATH.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>Saxon now also has an option to work with a source tree constructed using
               <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">XOM</a>. Saxon 8.3 is tested with XOM 1.0b7.
               To use Saxon with XOM,
               you need to add <code>saxon8-xom.jar</code> to your CLASSPATH.
            </p>
         </li>  
         
      </ul>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon has been tested successfully in the past with a wide variety of XML parsers including
         Xerces, Lark, SUN Project X, Crimson, Piccolo, Oracle XML, xerces, xml4j, and xp. Use of a SAX2-compliant
         parser is now mandatory. All the relevant classes must be installed on your Java CLASSPATH.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Earlier releases of Saxon included a version of the &AElig;lfred XML parser. This is no longer bundled with the
         Saxon distribution, because JDK 1.4 now includes an XML parser as standard, but the &AElig;lfred XML parser remains
         available as a separate download from
         <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=29872&amp;package_id=66578" target="_blank" class="bodylink">the Saxon site at SourceForge.</a></p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon's DOM interface has been tested with the Crimson parser included as standard in
         Sun's JDK 1.4 platform and with the Xerces 2.5.0 DOM implementation.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Because Saxon is run from the command line, you might find it useful (under Microsoft Windows)
         to have a text editor
         with better command-line support than the standard DOS window. I use <a href="http://www.jedit.org" target="_blank" class="bodylink">jEdit</a>, 
         which is an open source product with a wide-selection of optional plug-ins, including one for editing XQuery.
