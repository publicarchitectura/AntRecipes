      <h1>Using the JAXP XPath API</h1>
      
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon provides an API for executing XPath expressions. The API is an implementation of the JAXP 1.3
         XPath API, which in turn is loosely modelled
         on the DOM Level 3 API for XPath (which Saxon does not implement). 
         For full documentation, see the Javadoc description of package
         <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath</code>. Two sample applications using this API are available: they are called
         <code>XPathExample.java</code> and <code>ApplyXPathJAXP.java</code>,
         and can be found in the <code>samples/java</code> directory.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The  <code>XPathExample.java</code> application has been rewritten in Saxon 8.2 
         to use JAXP 1.3 interfaces.  To run this application, see the instructions
         in <a class="bodylink" href="javascript:topage('samples', 'shakespeare')">Shakespeare XPath Sample Application</a>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The <code>ApplyXPathJAXP.java</code> application is an enhanced version of the class of the
         same name issued as a sample application in the JAXP 1.3 distribution. It has been enhanced to show
         the use of more advanced features, such as the ability to bind namespaces, variables, and functions, and
         also to demonstrate use of the XPath API with different object models.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Because the XPath API in Saxon predates the introduction of the JAXP 1.3 XPath API, there is often more
         than one way of achieving the same effect. It is likely that in time, some of the native Saxon methods will
         be deprecated and replaced by the standard JAXP methods.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">An application using the JAXP 1.3 XPath API starts by instantiating a factory class. This is done by 
         calling:
      </p>
      
      
      <div class="codeblock" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px"><pre><code>
XPathFactory xpathFactory = XPathFactory.newInstance(objectModel);
XPath xpath = xpathFactory.newXPath();
</code></pre></div>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Here <code>objectModel</code> is a URI that identifies the object model you are using. Saxon recognizes
         four values for the object model:

      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">To ensure that Saxon is selected as your XPath implementation, you must specify one of these
         constants as your chosen object model, and you must ensure that the Java system property
         <code>javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory</code> is set to the value <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathFactoryImpl</code>.
         Normally, if Saxon is on your classpath then the Saxon XPath implementation will be picked up automatically, but
         if there are other implementations on the classpath as well then it is best to set the system property 
         explicitly to be sure.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">This API is based on the class <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathEvaluator</code>. This class provides a few
         simple configuration interfaces to set the source document, the static context, and the context node,
         plus a number of methods for evaluating XPath expressions.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The <code>XPath</code> object returned from the above calls allows you to set the static context for
         evaluating XPath expressions (you can pre-declare namespaces, variables, and functions), and to compile
         XPath expressions in this context. A compiled XPath expression (an object of class <code>XPathExpression</code>)
         can then be evaluated, with a supplied node (represented by a class in the selected object model) supplied
         as the context node. For further details, see the Javadoc specifications and the supplied example applications.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The JAXP specification leaves it rather up to the implementation how the results of an XPath expression will
         be returned. This is partly because it is defined only for XPath 1.0, which has a much simpler type system, and
         partly because it is deliberately designed to be independent of the object model used to represent XML trees.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">If you specify the return type <code>XPathConstants.BOOLEAN</code> then Saxon will return the effective
         boolean value of the expression, as a <code>java.lang.Boolean</code>. This is the same as wrapping the expression
         in a call of the XPath <code>boolean()</code> function.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">If you specify the return type <code>XPathConstants.STRING</code> then Saxon will return the result
         of the expression converted to a string, as a <code>java.lang.Boolean</code>. 
         This is the same as wrapping the expression in a call of the XPath <code>string()</code> function.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">If you specify the return type <code>XPathConstants.NUMBER</code> then Saxon will return the result
         of the expression converted to a double as a <code>java.lang.Double</code>. 
         This is the same as wrapping the expression in a call of the XPath <code>number()</code> function.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">If you specify the return type <code>XPathConstants.NODE</code> then Saxon will return the result
         the result as a node object in the selected object model. With the DOM model this will be an instance
         of <code>org.w3.dom.Node</code>, with the native Saxon model it will be an instance of <code>net.sf.saxon.om.NodeInfo</code>,
         and so on.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">If the return type is <code>XPathConstants.NODESET</code>, the result will be a Java <code>List</code>
         containing node objects in the selected object model. Note that the DOM <code>NodeList</code> class is <b>not</b>
         returned.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon does not recognize additional values for the return type other than the values defined in JAXP. If you
         want to return a different result type, for example a list of integers or a date, use one of the methods in which the result
         type is unspecified. If any conversions are necessary, do them within the XPath expression itself, using casts
         or constructor functions. The Java object that is returned will be a representation of the XPath value, 
         converted in the same way as arguments to a extension functions.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon's implementation of <code>XPathExpression</code> (namely <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathExpressionImpl</code>)
         provides additional methods for evaluating the XPath expression. In particular the <code>rawIterator()</code>
         method with no arguments returns a Saxon <code>SequenceIterator</code> which allows the application to process
         the results of any XPath expression, with no conversion: all values will be represented using a native Saxon class,
         for example a node will be represented as a <code>NodeInfo</code> and a QName as a <code>QNameValue</code>.
         The <code>NodeInfo</code> interface is described in the next section.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><i>The native Saxon methods rely on the dynamic context being established using separate <code>setXX()</code>
            calls on the <code>XPathExpressionImpl</code> object. If these methods are used, the <code>XPathExpression</code>
            object will not be thread-safe.</i></p>
      
      
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">XPath itself provides no sorting capability. You can therefore specify a sort order in which you want
         the results of an expression returned. This is done by nominating another expression, via the <code>setSortKey</code>
         method: this second expression is applied to each item in the result sequence, and its value determines
         the position of that item in the sorted result order.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">You can call methods directly on the <code>NodeInfo</code> object to get information about a node: for
         example <code>getDisplayName()</code> gets the name of the node in a form suitable for display, and
         <code>getStringValue()</code> gets the string value of the node, as defined in the XPath data model. You
         can also use the node as the context node for evaluation of subsequent expressions.
