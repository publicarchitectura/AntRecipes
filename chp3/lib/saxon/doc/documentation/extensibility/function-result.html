      <h1>Converting the Result of an Extension Function</h1>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">This section explains how the value returned by a Java extension function is converted
         to an XPath value. The same rules are used in converting a Java object supplied as a parameter
         to a stylesheet or query.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The result type of the method is converted to an XPath value as follows.</p>
      
      
      <ul xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
         
         <li>
            <p>If the method returns void, the XPath value is an empty sequence.</p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>If the method returns null, the XPath value is an empty sequence.</p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>If the method is a constructor, the XPath value is of type "wrapped Java object". The only way of
               using this is by passing it to another external function, or by converting it to one of the standard
               XPath data types as described above.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>If the returned value is a Java boolean or Boolean, the XPath result is a boolean.</p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>If the returned value is a Java double or Double, the XPath result is a double.</p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>If the returned value is a Java float or Float, the XPath result is a float.</p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>If the returned value is a Java int, short, long, character, or byte, or one of their object wrapper
               equivalents, the XPath result is an integer.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>If the returned value is a Java String, the XPath result is a string.</p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>If the returned value is an instance of the Saxon class <code>net.sf.saxon.om.NodeInfo</code>
               (a node in a Saxon tree), the XPath value will be a sequence containing a single node.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>If the returned value is an instance of <code>javax.xml.transform.Source</code> 
               (other than a <code>NodeInfo</code>), 
               a tree is built from the specified <code>Source</code> object, and the root node of this tree is returned as
               the result of the function.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>If the returned value is an instance of the Saxon class <code>net.sf.saxon.value.Value</code>,
               the returned value is used unchanged.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         
         
         
         <li>
            <p>If the returned value is is an instance of the Saxon class <code>net.sf.saxon.om.SequenceIterator</code>
               (an iterator over a sequence), the XPath
               value will be the sequence represented by this iterator. It is essential that this iterator
               properly implements the method <code>getAnother()</code> which returns a new iterator over the
               same sequence of nodes or values, positioned at the start of the sequence.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>If the returned value is an instance of the Java class <code>java.util.List</code>, or if it is an array,
               the XPath value will be the
               sequence represented by the contents of this <code>List</code> or array. The members of the list or array
               will each be converted
               to an XPath value, as if each member was supplied from a separate function call. An error is reported if
               the result contains a list or array nested within another list or array. 
               The contents of the list or array are copied immediately on return from the
               function, so the original <code>List</code> or array object itself may be safely re-used.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>If the returned value is a DOM Node, and it is recognized as a wrapper around a Saxon node, then the node
               is unwrapped and the underlying Saxon node is returned. If the returned value is some other kind of DOM Node, then
               a Saxon wrapper is added. (This is an imperfect solution, since it can lead to problems with node identity and document
               order.) 
            </p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>If the returned value is a DOM <code>NodeList</code>, the list of nodes is returned as a Saxon node-set. 
               Each node is handled in the same way as a Node that is returned directly as the result.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>If the result is any other Java object (including null), it is returned as a "wrapped Java object".</p>
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">In XSLT, the system function <code>function-available(String name)</code> returns true if there appears
         to be a method available with the right name. The function also has an optional second argument to test whether
         there is a method with the appropriate
         number of arguments. However, it is not possible to test whether the arguments are of appropriate types.
         If the function name is "new" it
         returns true so long as the class is not an abstract class or interface, and so long as it has at least
         one constructor.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">There are a number of extension functions supplied with the Saxon product: for details, see
         <a class="bodylink" href="javascript:topage('extensions', 'intro')">extensions.html</a>. The source code of these methods, which
         in most cases is extremely simple, can be used as an example for writing
         other user extension functions. It is found in class <code>net.sf.saxon.functions.Extensions</code>.
